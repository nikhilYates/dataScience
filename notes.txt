Key points:

- Boxplot: used to visually represent the outlier, maximum, quartiles and minimum of data sets (i.e., in charts)

- inferential statistics: getting information from a sample that can be applied to the population

- Simple random sampling: probability based, where every record/item has an equal chance of being picked up and is done without replacement

- Stratified sampling: records are divided based on 'Strata', records are chosen in equal proportions of Strata

- mean: x(bar)
- Standard Deviation: S
- Variance: S^2

- chose sample data that best represents population data parameters (sampling bias)
- Sampling Bias : sample whose members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others

- when choosing samples: 
	- Completeness
	- Validity
	- Accuracy
	- Availability
	- Timeliness
