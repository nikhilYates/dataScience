Key points:

IMPORTANT PLOTS:

- Boxplot: used to visually represent the outlier, maximum, quartiles and minimum of data sets (i.e., in charts)

STATISTICS:

- inferential statistics: getting information from a sample that can be applied to the population

- Simple random sampling: probability based, where every record/item has an equal chance of being picked up and is done without replacement

- Stratified sampling: records are divided based on 'Strata', records are chosen in equal proportions of Strata

- mean: x(bar)
- Standard Deviation: S
- Variance: S^2

- chose sample data that best represents population data parameters (sampling bias)
- Sampling Bias : sample whose members of the intended population are less likely to be included than others

- when choosing samples: 
	- Completeness
	- Validity
	- Accuracy
	- Availability
	- Timeliness

- Correlation:
	- Statistically Correlated: when x changes, y changes 
		- Strength of correlation: coefficient -> to calculate: r = SUM((x - xbar) * (y - ybar)) / ((num observations - 1) * stdDev(x) * stdDev(y))
		- r ranges from -1 < r < 1 (strong negative correlation to strong positive correlation)

		- direction of correlation: sign of the correlation

- Covariance: 
	- non-standardized
	- equation represents variance of X with respect to Y
	- does NOT tell us the strength of the relationship (that is what Correlation does)
	- This will help us determine the sign of the relationship (+/-)

	- Covariance matrix: compare each variable covariance:
		- i.e., for 2 variables X, Y: covariance(x, x), covariance(x, y), covariance(y, x), covariance(y, y)
			- covariance(x, x) = variance(x)
			- covariance(y, y) = variance(y)
	
	- Covariance applications:
		- Use covariance matrix as transformation matrix to determine eigenvalues and eigenvectors
		- financial portfolio management
			- i.e., giving us a group of stocks to invest in for a positive return

DISTRIBUTIONS

	- math function that shows us how probable an occurrence of difference outcomes is in an experiment
	- normal distribution: measure of variance of a set of values from some mean point
	- mean = median = mode
	- standard deviation defines the width of the graph
	- total area under the curve = 1

	- Z-Score:
		- probability-density function of 'z'
		- z = (x - mu) / sigma

	- Importance:
		- standardization
		- calculate probability within normal distribution
